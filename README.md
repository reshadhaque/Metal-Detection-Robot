# Metal-Detecting-Robot
## We designed, built, programed, and tested a remote controlled metal detector robot
The robot is battery operated and controlled using a microcontroller system. Commands are sent to the robot using a remote, and the robot sends information back to the remote that is displayed on a LCD. We added extra features like tracking the path of the robot and displaying the location of the metal detected by adding dots to the graph along the path. We also had options for adjusting speed of the robot and a mode where the robot loops in a square shape until metal is detected.
