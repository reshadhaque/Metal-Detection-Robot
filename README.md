# Metal-Detecting-Robot
We designed, built, and programmed a metal detecting robot! We used an EMF8 Microcontroller for the controller, STM32 for the robot, Embedded C for programming, and UART for communication. Our Robot has many features such as variable speed, metal strength detection, path plotting, and a sweep mode. Check out our video below.
